# Hypothesis-testing
## Background:
Bombay hospitality Ltd. operates a franchise model for producing exotic Norwegian dinners throughout New England. The operating cost for a franchise in a week (W) is given by the equation W = $1,000 + $5X, where X represents the number of units produced in a week. Recent feedback from restaurant owners suggests that this cost model may no longer be accurate, as their observed weekly operating costs are higher.
## Objective:
To investigate the restaurant owners' claim about the increase in weekly operating costs using hypothesis testing.
